## Title: You can be a kernel hacker

**Description**:

Writing operating systems sounds like it's only for wizards, but it
turns out that operating systems are written by humans like you and
me. I'm going to tell you what a kernel is and why you should care.
Then we'll talk about a few concrete ways to get started with kernel
hacking, ranging from the super-easy to the terrifyingly difficult.

**Session type**: 40 minutes

**Abstract**:

Writing operating systems sounds like it's only for wizards, but it
turns out that operating systems are written by humans like you and
me. I'm going to tell you what a kernel is and why you should care.
Then we'll talk about a few concrete ways to get started with working
with the Linux kernel, ranging from the super-easy to the terrifyingly
difficult.

Audience for this talk: programmers who think the Linux kernel is
scary, and would like fun suggestions for better understanding how it
works that don't involve posting to LKML. There will be absurd kernel
modules, barely-functional operating systems, and approachable kernel
code.

The goal is not to explain how the Linux kernel development process
works, but instead how to get started with the Linux kernel in a safe
and fun way without being involved in that process.

**Prerequisite knowledge**:

Some C programming experience would be good, but isn't required.

**Additional notes**:

I gave this talk at CUSEC 2014 (http://2014.cusec.net/), and people
loved it. The video for that should be up soon, but I gave it on Jan.
18, so it will take a while.

About fifteen people came up to me afterwards and told me they were
much less intimidated by kernel programming and wanted to get started
writing kernel modules.
