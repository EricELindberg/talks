# Title: Diving into Open Data with IPython Notebook & Pandas

### Outline

I'll walk you through Python's best tools for getting a grip on some
new open data: IPython Notebook and pandas. I'll show you how to read
in data, clean it up, graph it, and draw some conclusions, using some
open data about the number of cyclists on Montréal's bike paths as an
example.

### Detailed abstract

The idea is to choose a sample data set (cyclists on Montréal's bike
paths), and

* clean up the data (fix date formatting issues, remove null values,
* ...)
* graph the data
* download some weather data from the weather office website and look
  at the correlation between weather and number of people biking
* do some aggregation to find out how many people bike on Mondays vs
    Wednesdays
* talk about possible directions to take the project (make a model
  using scikit-learn or PyMC!)


### Additional notes

#### Speaking Experience

I gave a lightning talk similar to this at Montréal Python.
([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JJ102ZpoH0))

and you can see the IPython notebook using nbviewer
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/jvns/talks/master/mtlpy35/pistes-cyclables.ipynb).
I would be doing something similar to this, but expanded since it's a
longer talk.

#### Why I know about this

I work as a data scientist, and I've been spending all day every day
for the last 6 months working inside IPython Notebook and typing
'import pandas as pd' as the first line :)

### Status

This talk was accepted! I gave it! It went well!

The bit about using scikit-learn or PyMC didn't make it into the final
talk at all.
