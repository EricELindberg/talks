<!-- "this is what we're going to talk about" -->

# step 1: read a cool paper


<img src="paper.png">


# neural networks aren't magic: they're math

# i have a math degree i can do this =D

# what the paper said

# what the paper said

# can I implement the paper???

# yes

# the code for this is is all an ipython notebook

# a neural network is a function

# what you can do next

* read the paper!
* play with the neural net yourself!
* michael nielsen's neural networks book

# papers we love

# if we can trick a neural network, maybe we can understand it

# ok, so machine learning is cool

# machine learning is also *important*

(otherwise i would never get paid to do it)

* photo classification
* spam filtering
* approving your loan application

# reasons to be skeptical of machine learning

# 1. only as good as the data you put into it

# 3. you didn't tell your model about people

# be skeptical <br> & <br> ask questions

# okay, I found something weird. how do I debug it?

# 1. look at the model

income = 1000 * age + 10000 * gender

# 2. make two models

1. model your data with a complicated model
1. model your complicated model with a simple model

# 3. talk to an academic

* PhD students = AMAZING
* NIPS = really fun

# it's math, <br>not magic

# simple systems can work incredibly well
