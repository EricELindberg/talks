<!-- who's excited about MACHINE LEARNING -->

# who am I

<!-- ml engineer; machine learning is my job. not a neural networks expert! -->

# "neural networks seem really cool"

# 

## neural networks <br><br> deep learning <br><br> "magic"

<!-- "this is what we're going to talk about" -->

# very mysterious

<!-- put picture of a black bos here -->

# 

## is it magic only google can do? <br> Can **I** do it?

<!-- picture of paper -->

# neural networks aren't magic: they're math

# i have a math degree i can do this =D

# this talk

1. what even is a neural network
1. download a neural network
1. play with it ("is this a cat?")
1. trick it


# step 1: what even is a neural network

<!-- a function -->

# image classification

#

# a neural network is a (deterministic!!) function

# what we learned

* a neural net is a function
* made up of many simple functions
* that you learn from some data

# step 2: download a neural network

</section>

<section data-background="download_neural_network.png">

# 50 megabytes


# step 3: PREDICT SOME THINGS WITH IT

# demo demo demo

# step 4: trick it

# 

## don't trust machine learning models <br> <br> try to trick the model!

# what you can do next

* read the paper!
* play with the neural net yourself!
* read other machine learning papers
* try out tensorflow!
* ask me questions!

# thanks! questions?
