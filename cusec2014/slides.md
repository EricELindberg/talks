# Where we're going

1. WTF is a kernel?
2. Why should you care?
3. Strategies for getting started with kernel programming
    a. Read some kernel code!
    b. Write a kernel module!
    c. Write your own operating system
    d. Do an internship

# 1. WTF is a kernel?

# Kernels are <br> just code!

#

When I go to http://google.com, kernel code runs for:

+ Typing in the address
+ Handling every network packet
+ Writing history files to disk
+ Allocating memory
+ Communicating with the graphics card

# How to call <br> kernel code

System calls!!!

# System calls

* open a file! (`open`)
* start a program! (`execve`)
* change a file's permissions! (`chmod`)

# What we've learned 

+ Your kernel does tons of stuff
+ Programs tell it what to do using system calls

# 2. Why should you care?

Put some silly pictures here. It will be better.

+ It's fun!
+ People will think you're a badass
+ You'll become a better programmer

# That's about it

Now, go communicate something!
