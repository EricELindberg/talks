# Where we're going

* What is a kernel????
* Strategies for getting started with kernel programming
    a. Write a kernel module!
    b. Do a challenge
    c. Do an internship

# What is a kernel?!?

# Kernels are <br> just code!

#

When I go to http://google.com, kernel code runs for:

+ Typing in the address
+ Handling every network packet
+ Writing history files to disk
+ Allocating memory
+ Communicating with the graphics card

# How to call <br> kernel code

System calls!!!

# System calls: <br> a kernel's API

* open a file! (`open`)
* start a program! (`execve`)
* change a file's permissions! (`chmod`)

# What we've learned 

+ Your kernel does tons of stuff
+ Programs tell it what to do using system calls

# Strategies for getting started

# Strategy 1: <br> Write a <br> Linux kernel module

# Okay no more <br> code I promise

# Strategy 2: <br> Eudalypta challenge

The problems are hard! but possible.

# Strategy 3: <br> Do a Linux kernel <br> internship

# Linux Internships

+ Google Summer of Code
+ GNOME Outreach Program for Women
